Thegoalofthisprojectwastoﬁndapotentialsolutiontotheproblemofmedicalnon-adherencethrough the method of project based learning. We have created a team and developed its identity. We have ﬁrst stated eight potential causes and then researched each of them. We have narrowed their number down to four. We have also conducted an online survey. We concluded that the most common causes of medical non-adherence that we could address are the ones related to mental state. Our target group would be the elderly. We have considered a few ideas. Our solution would be a mobile application connected with a box for storing medication. We performed a state of art analysis to establish their features. We veriﬁed our idea by conducting an interview. We wrote the prototype of the mobile application in Java, and we assembled the box using various electronic components and a plastic box. Our prototype received a positive review from a person from our target group.
